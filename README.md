Assignment Objectives
Upon completion of this assignment, students will be able to:

1. Design and implement parallel programs using multiple parallel computing paradigms
2. Deploy and execute parallel applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
3. Analyze performance characteristics of parallel algorithms through speedup and efficiency metrics

Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a parallel image processing system that applies various filters to a collection of images from the Food-101 dataset. You will implement the same image processing pipeline using different parallel programming paradigms and deploy your implementations on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This assignment will help you understand the trade-offs between different parallelization approaches and gain hands-on experience with cloud computing.
